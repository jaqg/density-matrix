The objective is to create a program to test the approximations described in
this document.
The intention is to establish a testing environment for future parametrization 
of the proposed approximation discussed in the previous section.

The entire program can be found on 
\href{https://github.com/jaqg/density-matrix}{Github}.
The user must be warned that the program is still in development and, at this
point, not intended to be efficient.

The testing is performed by comparing properties dependent of the
RDMs with Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF),
MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order (MP2) and
Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations.
In this case, the ground state energy and the Minkowski distance, which serves
as a direct metric for the approximated 2-RDMs.

It should be noted that, since the part of the program specified in this section
is donde in MO basis, both integrals and density matrices are expressed in
Mulliken notation (see \cref{eq:mulliken-notation}).
