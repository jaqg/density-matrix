    \field{abstract}{%
    This chapter develops the formalism of second quantization, laying the foundation for subsequent treatment of molecular electronic structure. In a given spin-orbital basis, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Slater determinants with spin orbitals in canonical order and the occupation-number (ON) vectors in the Fock space. In second quantization, all operators and states can be constructed from a set of elementary creation and annihilation operators. The chapter turns to operators that conserve the particle number and thus couple ON vectors in the same subspace. The explicit form of these number-conserving operators depends on whether the first-quantized operator is a one-electron operator or a two-electron operator. One-electron operators are discussed followed by two-electron operators along with the second-quantization representation of the electronic Hamiltonian operator.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Some formal requirements for the second-order reduced density matrix are discussed in the context of density matrix functional theory. They serve as a basis for the ad hoc construction of the second-order reduced density matrix in terms of the first-order reduced density matrix and lead to implicit functionals where the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals are obtained as diagonal elements of an idempotent matrix the elements of which represent the variational parameters to be optimized. The numerical results obtained from a first realization of such an implicit density matrix functional give excellent agreement with the results of full configuration interaction calculations for four-electron systems like LiH and Be. Results for H2O taken as an example for a somewhat larger molecule are numerically less satisfactory but still give reasonable occupation numbers of the natural orbitals and indicate the capability of density matrix functional theory to cope with static electron correlation.%

    The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is extended to the case that the external potential is nonlocal. It is shown that, in this more general case, a nondegenerate ground-state wave function is a universal functional of the one-particle density kernel Î¼(x,xâ€²), but probably not of the particle density n(â†’r)=Î£sÎ¼(â†’rs,â†’rs). The variational equations for the local and nonlocal cases are compared. The former must be replaced by a variational equation for an equivalent system of noninteracting particles, following a prescription of Kohn and Sham, in order to obtain a SchrÃ¶dinger-like form, and contains only local potentials. The latter may be obtained directly in SchrÃ¶dinger-like form, but the exchange-correlation potential is nonlocal. If the nonlocal pseudo-Hamiltonian exists [i.e., if the functional derivative Î´EÎ´Î¼(x,xâ€²) exists for a nondegenerate ground-state density kernel], then the eigenfunctions of the pseudo-Hamiltonian are natural spin orbitals, and all partially occupied orbitals (0{$<$}âŸ¨Ï†i|Î¼|Ï†iâŸ©{$<$}1) belong to the same degenerate eigenvalue of the pseudo-Hamiltonian. Finally, it is shown, as a corollary of Coleman's theorem for N-representable density kernels, that any finite non-negative differentiable function is an N-representable particle density.%

    This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression Eâ‰¡âˆ«v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+Ëœn(r), Ëœnn0â‰ª1, and (2) n(r)=Ï•(rr0) with Ï• arbitrary and r0â†’âˆž. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.%

    The Hohenbergâ€“Kohn theorem implies the existence of an energy functional based solely on the firstâ€order reduced density matrix of the ground state of an atomic or molecular system. Application of the variational principle for the functional EvM[Î³] generates a set of coupled Euler equations for the representation coefficients and spin orbitals of a rankâ€M approximation to the exact groundâ€state density matrix. Defining the (assumed Hermitian) kernel FM[Î³;xâ€²,x]â‰¡Î´EvM/Î´Î³ (x,xâ€²), the equations in an arbitrary representation for the approximate density matrix, Î³ (x,xâ€²) =Î£ijMÏˆ1(x) Î³ijÏˆj* (xâ€²) are the following: â„±dÎ¾FM[Î³;xâ€²,Î¾]Ïˆi(Î¾) =Î¼Ïˆi(xâ€²); i=1, 2,...,M; â„±dÎ¾FM[Î³;xâ€²,Î¾] Î£MiÏˆi(Î¾) Î³ ij=Î£MiÏˆi(xâ€²) Î»ij; j=1, 2, ...,M. The quantity Î¼ is the chemical potential of the system of interest and the Î»ij are a set of M2 Lagrange multipliers constraining the orthonormality of the spin orbital basis \{Ïˆ\}. The coefficients Î³ij must be chosen such that FM has the degenerate eigenvalue spectrum, FiiM=Î¼, i=1, 2,...,M, for all partially occupied orbitals. The spin orbitals, for a fixed set of coefficients, must be simultaneously determined so that Î» is Hermitian. Provided all occupation numbers lie on the open interval (0,1), the stationary density matrix itself obeys the eigenvalue equation â„±dÎ¾FM[Î³;x,Î¾]Î³ (Î¾,xâ€²) =Î¼Î³ (x,xâ€²), and for any stationary density matrix the following commutation rules are valid: [FM[Î³], Î³]=0; [Î», Î³]=0. The matrices Î³ and Î» consequently can be brought simultaneously to diagonal form, and the canonical representation of the energy functional provides an eigenvalue equation determining the natural spin orbitals. The value of the chemical potential is Î¼=Îµi/ni, i=1, 2, ...,M; Îµ=diag (Î»); from which follows the distribution function governing the occupation numbers of a stationary density matrix. Two limiting forms of the variational principle are examined, the exact and Hartreeâ€“Fock
  functionals, and related previous work by Gilbert is discussed. The physical content of the equations is illuminated by identification of the chemical potential as the negative of the electronegativity; Sandersonâ€™s Principle of Electronegativity Equalization follows.%

    Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electronâ€”electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density Ï. Q[Ï] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Î¨Ï which yield the fixed. Ï. Q[Ï] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electronâ€”electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix Î³, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartreeâ€”Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.%

    It is shown that only a small piece of the exact universal variational functional of the one matrix is actually unknown. The unknown piece, EC[Î³], is identified and several rigorous properties of EC[Î³] are derived. Based upon the derived properties, approximate forms of EC[Î³] are displayed for the purpose of actual calculations, Existence theorems are then proved which allow the â€œsingle-shotâ€ determination of exact correlation energies directly from Hartree-Fock and exchange-only densities. In fact, all ground-state and excited-state properties of the system are determined by these densities. The existence theorems do not generally apply, however, a, to finite basis sets. EC [Î³] is then compared with \$\$\{\textbackslash tilde E\_c\}\textbackslash left[ \textbackslash rho \textbackslash right]\$\$which is the â€œsingle-shotâ€ universal correlation energy functional of the Hartree- Fock density which is put forth as the correction to the Hartree-Fock energy.%

    Levyâ€™s 1â€matrix energy functional (Ref. 4) is modified and extended to include all ensembleâ€“representable lâ€matrices in its domain. This constitutes both a generalization and a simplification of earlier observations by Gilbert. The generalization negates some criticisms of the Donnellyâ€“Parr analysis of a 1â€matrix energy functional (Ref. 3) since it was assumed to be defined only for pureâ€state representable 1â€matrices. Further study of this analysis suggests that the taking of arbitrary variations in the 1â€matrix at a certain point in their study may result in an invalid Euler equation for the 1â€matrix energy functional, although this does not alter the main results of that work. The redefinition of Levyâ€™s functional to accommodate the larger domain allows direct application of Harrimanâ€™s analysis of the geometry of density matrices in finite dimensional situations. A decomposition of the equivalent of the Vee expectation value into two terms, one with explicit and another with implicit occupation number dependence, illustrates the role of Nâ€representability. The Vee expectation value is approximated by means of the Schwartz inequality.%

    A oneâ€toâ€one mapping between the oneâ€particle densities and a particular set of nâ€particle ensembles is constructed. The construction entails simultaneous minimization of the energy and minimization of the L2â€norm over the set of ensembles which yield a given density. Differences between the present approach to density functional theory and other approaches, such as Kohnâ€“Sham theory (Ref. 12) and Thomasâ€“Fermiâ€“Diracâ€“Weizsacker theory (Ref.13) are emphasized. The Levy density functional may be decomposed into kinetic and electronâ€“electron interaction components.%

    The equivalence between Fe[Î³] and FP[Î³] over p1n is shown, where Fe[Î³] is the universal energy functional defined in the domain E1n of ensemble representable reduced first-order density operators Î³, and Fp[Î³], the corresponding functional over P1n, the set of pure state n-representable Î³1s. The construction of Fe[Î³] or equivalently of Fp[Î³]n over P1n is considered by imposing the explicit requirement that Î“, the nth-order density operator, map into Î³; this condition is introduced into the variational functional by means of a matrix Î± of Lagrange multipliers. The ensuing functional F[Î³] is then used in order to obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations for the one-matrix Î³. For the purpose of illustrating the present formalism, an explicit derivation of the Hartree-Fock equations as a particular case of the general Euler-Lagrange equations obtained herein, is given.%

    The exchange-correlation energy in Kohn-Sham density functional theory is expressed as a functional of the electronic density and the Kohn-Sham orbitals. An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory is to express the energy as a functional of the reduced first-order density matrix or equivalently the natural orbitals. We present an approximate, simple, and parameter-free functional of the natural orbitals, based solely on scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a sum rule. Our tests on atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge densities than the Hartree-Fock method, the local density approximation, and the generalized gradient approximations.%

    The correlation effects in the ground state of the Heâ€like ions are investigated by using the idea that the two electrons may occupy different orbitals in space. By using a scale factor Î· and a splitting parameter v, a radial function [open phi][r] is split into two different orbitals, [open phi][Î·(1+v)r] and [open phi][Î·(1â€”v)r], following Hylleraas [E. A. Hylleraas, Z. Physik 54, 347 (1929)], and Eckart [C. Eckart, Phys. Rev. 36, 878 (1930)]. It is shown that by using orbitals obtained by splitting a simple exponential function, a surprisingly large amount of the radial correlation energy may be taken into account, whereas an attempt to split the atomic selfâ€consistent field function for He led to a negative result. The lowest triplet state is also treated by using the same approach.%

    This paper gives a natural orbital (NO) based analysis of the van der Waals interaction in (singlet) H2 at long distance. The van der Waals interaction, even if not leading to a distinct van der Waals well, affects the shape of the interaction potential in the van der Waals distance range of 5â€“9 bohrs and can be clearly distinguished from chemical bonding effects. In the NO basis the van der Waals interaction can be quantitatively covered with, apart from the ground state configurations (1Ïƒg)2 and (1Ïƒu)2, just the 4 configurations (2Ïƒg)2 and (2Ïƒu)2, and (1Ï€u)2 and (1Ï€g)2. The physics of the dispersion interaction requires and explains the peculiar relatively large positive CI coefficients of the doubly excited electron configurations (2Ïƒu)2 and (1Ï€g)2 (the occupancy amplitudes of the 2Ïƒu and 1Ï€gx, y NOs) in the distance range 5â€“9 bohrs, which have been observed before by Cioslowski and Pernal [Chem. Phys. Lett.\hphantom{,}430, 188 (2006)]10.1016/j.cplett.2006.08.111. We show that such positive occupancy amplitudes do not necessarily lead to the existence of zero occupation numbers at some H-H distances.%

    In singlet two-electron systems, the natural occupation numbers of the one-particle reduced density matrix are given as squares of the natural amplitudes which are defined as the expansion coefficients of the two-electron wave function in a natural orbital basis. In this work, we relate the sign of the natural amplitudes to the nature of the two-body interaction. We show that long-range Coulomb-type interactions are responsible for the appearance of positive amplitudes and give both analytical and numerical examples that illustrate how the long-distance structure of the wave function affects these amplitudes. We further demonstrate that the amplitudes show an avoided crossing behavior as function of a parameter in the Hamiltonian and use this feature to show that these amplitudes never become zero, except for special interactions in which infinitely many of them can become zero simultaneously when changing the interaction strength. This mechanism of avoided crossings provides an alternative argument for the non-vanishing of the natural occupation numbers in Coulomb systems.%

    A detailed analysis that benefits from a slate of new approximate numerical and exact asymptotic results produces highly accurate properties of the ground state of the harmonium atom as functions of the confinement strength Ï‰ and quantifies the domains of the weakly and strongly correlated regimes in this system. The former regime, which encompasses the values of Ï‰ greater than Ï‰critâ‰ˆ4.011{$\mkern1mu$}624Ã—10âˆ’2, is characterized by the one-electron density Ï(Ï‰;r1) with a global maximum at r1=0. In contrast, the harmonium atom within the latter regime, which corresponds to Ï‰\&lt;Ï‰crit, differs fundamentally from both its weakly correlated counterpart and Coulombic systems. Resembling a Wigner crystal of a homogeneous electron gas, it possesses a radially localized pair of angularly correlated electrons that gives rise to Ï(Ï‰;r1) with a â€œfat attractorâ€ composed of a cage critical point and a (1, âˆ’1) critical sphere. Allowing for a continuous variation in Ï‰, the new compact representation of the ground-state wave function and accurate approximants for the corresponding electronic properties are designed to facilitate the use of harmonium in research on electron correlation and density functionals.%

    For closed-shell systems, a particular parametrization of coefficients in a configuration interaction (CI) expansion provides a convenient formulation for the search over electronic wave functions constrained by a set of natural orbitals (NOs) and the corresponding occupation numbers that are invoked in every variational construction of the density matrix functional (DMF) Vee(Î“) for the electronâ€“electron repulsion energy. It produces an explicit expression for Vee in terms of the Coulomb and exchange integrals over NOs, and an idempotent matrix Ï‰, diagonal elements of which equal the occupation numbers. At the same time, it reveals a very serious bottleneck affecting any rigorous approach to the DMF theory, namely the phase dilemma that stems from the necessity to carry out minimization over a large number of possible combinations of CI coefficient signs. While underscoring its lack of variational nature, a simple approximation for the phase factor products provides a strict derivation for the recently proposed Kollmarâ€“Hess functional.%

    For chemistry an accurate description of bond weakening and breaking is vital. The great advantage of density matrix functionals, as opposed to density functionals, is their ability to describe such processes since they naturally cover both nondynamical and dynamical correlation. This is obvious in the LÃ¶wdin-Shull functional, the exact natural orbital functional for two-electron systems. We present in this paper extensions of this functional for the breaking of a single electron pair bond in N-electron molecules, using LiH, BeH+, and Li2 molecules as prototypes. Attention is given to the proper formulation of the functional in terms of not just J and K integrals but also the two-electron L integrals (K integrals with a different distribution of the complex conjugation of the orbitals), which is crucial for the calculation of response functions. Accurate energy curves are obtained with extended LÃ¶wdin-Shull functionals along the complete dissociation coordinate using full CI calculations as benchmark.%

    A class of approximation of the two-particle density matrix d2 resembling the Hartree-Fock dependence on the one-particle density matrix d1 is suggested. The integral relation between d2 and d1 is exactly maintained. An optimal choice is performed by means of the Pauli principle. The smallness of the error when applied to Coulomb systems, is qualitatively discussed. Extended Thomas-Fermi theory, as recently introduced by the authors is shortly outlined for the case of Coulomb interaction.%

    An improved density matrix functional [correction to Buijse and Baerends functional (BBC)] is proposed, in which a hierarchy of physically motivated repulsive corrections is employed to the strongly overbinding functional of Buijse and Baerends (BB). The first correction C1 restores the repulsive exchange-correlation (xc) interaction between electrons in weakly occupied natural orbitals (NOs) as it appears in the exact electron pair density Ï2 for the limiting two-electron case. The second correction C2 reduces the xc interaction of the BB functional between electrons in strongly occupied NOs to an exchange-type interaction. The third correction C3 employs a similar reduction for the interaction of the antibonding orbital of a dissociating molecular bond. In addition, C3 applies a selective cancellation of diagonal terms in the Coulomb and xc energies (not for the frontier orbitals). With these corrections, BBC still retains a correct description of strong nondynamical correlation for the dissociating electron pair bond. BBC greatly improves the quality of the BB potential energy curves for the prototype few-electron molecules and in several cases BBC reproduces very well the benchmark ab initio potential curves. The average error of the self-consistent correlation energies obtained with BBC3 for prototype atomic systems and molecular systems at the equilibrium geometry is only ca. 6\%.%

    A recently proposed series of corrections to the earliest JK-only functionals has considerably improved the prospects of density matrix functional theory (DMFT). Still, the most advanced of these functionals (correction C3) requires a preselection of the terms in the pair density Î“(r1,r2) involving the bonding and antibonding natural orbitals (NOs) belonging to an electron pair bond. Ideally, a DMFT functional should only depend on the NOs and their occupation numbers, and we propose a functional with an occupation number driven weighing of terms in the pair density. These are formulated as â€œdampingâ€ for certain ranges of occupation numbers of the two-electron cumulant that arises in the expansion of the two-particle density matrix of the paradigmatic two-electron system. This automatic version of C3, which we denote AC3, provides the correct dissociation limit for electron pair bonds and it excellently reproduces the potential energy curves of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method for the dissociation of the electron pair bond in the series of the ten-electron hydrides CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF. AC3 reproduces closely the experimental equilibrium distances and at Re it yields correlation energies of the ten-electron systems with an average error in the absolute values of only 3.3\% compared to the MRCI values. We stress the importance of treatment of strong correlation cases (NO occupation numbers differing significantly from 2.0 and 0.0) by appropriate terms in the cumulant.%

    Reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is a promising alternative approach to the problem of electron correlation. Like standard density functional theory, it contains an unknown exchange-correlation functional, for which several approximations have been proposed in the last years. In this article, we benchmark some of these functionals in an extended set of molecules with respect to total and atomization energies. Our results show that the most recent RDMFT functionals give very satisfactory results compared to standard quantum chemistry and density functional approaches.%

    It is demonstrated that the â€œcorrected Hartreeâ€“Fockâ€ (CHF) density matrix functional proposed by CsÃ¡nyi and Arias is identical with the Hartreeâ€“Fockâ€“Bogoliubov (HFB) functional of the generalized density matrix up to the sign of the pairing energy term. Using this analogy, variational CHF calculations can be performed much more efficiently by solving the HFB equations for the generalized density matrix than by optimizing separately the natural orbitals and their occupations numbers. A family of CHF-type functionals with a scaled pairing energy is introduced and compared to the closely related antisymmetrized geminal power method.%
