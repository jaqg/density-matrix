  abstract = {A detailed analysis that benefits from a slate of new approximate numerical and exact asymptotic results produces highly accurate properties of the ground state of the harmonium atom as functions of the confinement strength ω and quantifies the domains of the weakly and strongly correlated regimes in this system. The former regime, which encompasses the values of ω greater than ωcrit≈4.011{$\mkern1mu$}624×10−2, is characterized by the one-electron density ρ(ω;r1) with a global maximum at r1=0. In contrast, the harmonium atom within the latter regime, which corresponds to ω\&lt;ωcrit, differs fundamentally from both its weakly correlated counterpart and Coulombic systems. Resembling a Wigner crystal of a homogeneous electron gas, it possesses a radially localized pair of angularly correlated electrons that gives rise to ρ(ω;r1) with a “fat attractor” composed of a cage critical point and a (1, −1) critical sphere. Allowing for a continuous variation in ω, the new compact representation of the ground-state wave function and accurate approximants for the corresponding electronic properties are designed to facilitate the use of harmonium in research on electron correlation and density functionals.},

Extremization of the electronic energy functional, which is a sum of Vee[Γ(x′,x)] and the contraction of Γ(x′,x) with the core Hamiltonian, produces the (approximate) ground-state energy even if E0(η,g) itself is not variational.

Ten conditions that have to be satisfied by Vee(n;g) uncover several characteristics of Vee[Γ(x′,x)].

  abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.}

  abstract = {The Hohenberg–Kohn theorem implies the existence of an energy functional based solely on the first‐order reduced density matrix of the ground state of an atomic or molecular system. Application of the variational principle for the functional EvM[γ] generates a set of coupled Euler equations for the representation coefficients and spin orbitals of a rank‐M approximation to the exact ground‐state density matrix. Defining the (assumed Hermitian) kernel FM[γ;x′,x]≡δEvM/δγ (x,x′), the equations in an arbitrary representation for the approximate density matrix, γ (x,x′) =ΣijMψ1(x) γijψj* (x′) are the following: ℱdξFM[γ;x′,ξ]ψi(ξ) =μψi(x′); i=1, 2,...,M; ℱdξFM[γ;x′,ξ] ΣMiψi(ξ) γ ij=ΣMiψi(x′) λij; j=1, 2, ...,M. The quantity μ is the chemical potential of the system of interest and the λij are a set of M2 Lagrange multipliers constraining the orthonormality of the spin orbital basis \{ψ\}. The coefficients γij must be chosen such that FM has the degenerate eigenvalue spectrum, FiiM=μ, i=1, 2,...,M, for all partially occupied orbitals. The spin orbitals, for a fixed set of coefficients, must be simultaneously determined so that λ is Hermitian. Provided all occupation numbers lie on the open interval (0,1), the stationary density matrix itself obeys the eigenvalue equation ℱdξFM[γ;x,ξ]γ (ξ,x′) =μγ (x,x′), and for any stationary density matrix the following commutation rules are valid: [FM[γ], γ]=0; [λ, γ]=0. The matrices γ and λ consequently can be brought simultaneously to diagonal form, and the canonical representation of the energy functional provides an eigenvalue equation determining the natural spin orbitals. The value of the chemical potential is μ=εi/ni, i=1, 2, ...,M; ε=diag (λ); from which follows the distribution function governing the occupation numbers of a stationary density matrix. Two limiting forms of the variational principle are examined, the exact and Hartree–Fock functionals, and related previous work by Gilbert is discussed. The physical content of the equations is illuminated by identification of the chemical potential as the negative of the electronegativity; Sanderson’s Principle of Electronegativity Equalization follows.},

In this work, we relate the sign of the natural amplitudes to the nature of the two-body interaction. We show that long-range Coulomb-type interactions are responsible for the appearance of positive amplitudes and give both analytical and numerical examples that illustrate how the long-distance structure of the wave function affects these amplitudes. We further demonstrate that the amplitudes show an avoided crossing behavior as function of a parameter in the Hamiltonian and use this feature to show that these amplitudes never become zero, except for special interactions in which infinitely many of them can become zero simultaneously when changing the interaction strength. This mechanism of avoided crossings provides an alternative argument for the non-vanishing of the natural occupation numbers in Coulomb systems.},

It is shown that, in this more general case, a nondegenerate ground-state wave function is a universal functional of the one-particle density kernel μ(x,x′), but probably not of the particle density n(→r)=Σsμ(→rs,→rs). The variational equations for the local and nonlocal cases are compared. The former must be replaced by a variational equation for an equivalent system of noninteracting particles, following a prescription of Kohn and Sham, in order to obtain a Schrödinger-like form, and contains only local potentials. The latter may be obtained directly in Schrödinger-like form, but the exchange-correlation potential is nonlocal. If the nonlocal pseudo-Hamiltonian exists [i.e., if the functional derivative δEδμ(x,x′) exists for a nondegenerate ground-state density kernel], then the eigenfunctions of the pseudo-Hamiltonian are natural spin orbitals, and all partially occupied orbitals (0{$<$}⟨φi|μ|φi⟩{$<$}1) belong to the same degenerate eigenvalue of the pseudo-Hamiltonian. Finally, it is shown, as a corollary of Coleman's theorem for N-representable density kernels, that any finite non-negative differentiable function is an N-representable particle density.},

In a given spin-orbital basis, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Slater determinants with spin orbitals in canonical order and the occupation-number (ON) vectors in the Fock space. In second quantization, all operators and states can be constructed from a set of elementary creation and annihilation operators. The chapter turns to operators that conserve the particle number and thus couple ON vectors in the same subspace. The explicit form of these number-conserving operators depends on whether the first-quantized operator is a one-electron operator or a two-electron operator. One-electron operators are discussed followed by two-electron operators along with the second-quantization representation of the electronic Hamiltonian operator.},

The numerical results obtained from a first realization of such an implicit density matrix functional give excellent agreement with the results of full configuration interaction calculations for four-electron systems like LiH and Be. Results for H2O taken as an example for a somewhat larger molecule are numerically less satisfactory but still give reasonable occupation numbers of the natural orbitals and indicate the capability of density matrix functional theory to cope with static electron correlation.},

  abstract = {For chemistry an accurate description of bond weakening and breaking is vital. The great advantage of density matrix functionals, as opposed to density functionals, is their ability to describe such processes since they naturally cover both nondynamical and dynamical correlation. This is obvious in the Löwdin-Shull functional, the exact natural orbital functional for two-electron systems. We present in this paper extensions of this functional for the breaking of a single electron pair bond in N-electron molecules, using LiH, BeH+, and Li2 molecules as prototypes. Attention is given to the proper formulation of the functional in terms of not just J and K integrals but also the two-electron L integrals (K integrals with a different distribution of the complex conjugation of the orbitals), which is crucial for the calculation of response functions. Accurate energy curves are obtained with extended Löwdin-Shull functionals along the complete dissociation coordinate using full CI calculations as benchmark.},

It produces an explicit expression for Vee in terms of the Coulomb and exchange integrals over NOs, and an idempotent matrix ω, diagonal elements of which equal the occupation numbers. At the same time, it reveals a very serious bottleneck affecting any rigorous approach to the DMF theory, namely the phase dilemma that stems from the necessity to carry out minimization over a large number of possible combinations of CI coefficient signs. While underscoring its lack of variational nature, a simple approximation for the phase factor products provides a strict derivation for the recently proposed Kollmar–Hess functional.},

  abstract = {A recently proposed series of corrections to the earliest JK-only functionals has considerably improved the prospects of density matrix functional theory (DMFT). Still, the most advanced of these functionals (correction C3) requires a preselection of the terms in the pair density Γ(r1,r2) involving the bonding and antibonding natural orbitals (NOs) belonging to an electron pair bond. Ideally, a DMFT functional should only depend on the NOs and their occupation numbers, and we propose a functional with an occupation number driven weighing of terms in the pair density. These are formulated as “damping” for certain ranges of occupation numbers of the two-electron cumulant that arises in the expansion of the two-particle density matrix of the paradigmatic two-electron system. This automatic version of C3, which we denote AC3, provides the correct dissociation limit for electron pair bonds and it excellently reproduces the potential energy curves of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method for the dissociation of the electron pair bond in the series of the ten-electron hydrides CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF. AC3 reproduces closely the experimental equilibrium distances and at Re it yields correlation energies of the ten-electron systems with an average error in the absolute values of only 3.3\% compared to the MRCI values. We stress the importance of treatment of strong correlation cases (NO occupation numbers differing significantly from 2.0 and 0.0) by appropriate terms in the cumulant.},

The van der Waals interaction, even if not leading to a distinct van der Waals well, affects the shape of the interaction potential in the van der Waals distance range of 5–9 bohrs and can be clearly distinguished from chemical bonding effects. In the NO basis the van der Waals interaction can be quantitatively covered with, apart from the ground state configurations (1σg)2 and (1σu)2, just the 4 configurations (2σg)2 and (2σu)2, and (1πu)2 and (1πg)2. The physics of the dispersion interaction requires and explains the peculiar relatively large positive CI coefficients of the doubly excited electron configurations (2σu)2 and (1πg)2 (the occupancy amplitudes of the 2σu and 1πgx, y NOs) in the distance range 5–9 bohrs, which have been observed before by Cioslowski and Pernal [Chem. Phys. Lett.\hphantom{,}430, 188 (2006)]10.1016/j.cplett.2006.08.111.

Hylleraas, Z. Physik 54, 347 (1929)], and Eckart [C. Eckart, Phys. Rev. 36, 878 (1930)]. It is shown that by using orbitals obtained by splitting a simple exponential function, a surprisingly large amount of the radial correlation energy may be taken into account, whereas an attempt to split the atomic self‐consistent field function for He led to a negative result. The lowest triplet state is also treated by using the same approach.},

  abstract = {Levy’s 1‐matrix energy functional (Ref. 4) is modified and extended to include all ensemble–representable l‐matrices in its domain. This constitutes both a generalization and a simplification of earlier observations by Gilbert. The generalization negates some criticisms of the Donnelly–Parr analysis of a 1‐matrix energy functional (Ref. 3) since it was assumed to be defined only for pure‐state representable 1‐matrices. Further study of this analysis suggests that the taking of arbitrary variations in the 1‐matrix at a certain point in their study may result in an invalid Euler equation for the 1‐matrix energy functional, although this does not alter the main results of that work. The redefinition of Levy’s functional to accommodate the larger domain allows direct application of Harriman’s analysis of the geometry of density matrices in finite dimensional situations. A decomposition of the equivalent of the Vee expectation value into two terms, one with explicit and another with implicit occupation number dependence, illustrates the role of N‐representability. The Vee expectation value is approximated by means of the Schwartz inequality.},
