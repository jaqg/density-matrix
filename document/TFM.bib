  abstract = {Dalton is a powerful general-purpose program system for the study of molecular electronic structure at the Hartree–Fock, Kohn–Sham, multiconfigurational self-consistent-field, Møller–Plesset, configuration-interaction, and coupled-cluster levels of theory. Apart from the total energy, a wide variety of molecular properties may be calculated using these electronic-structure models. Molecular gradients and Hessians are available for geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics, and vibrational studies, whereas magnetic resonance and optical activity can be studied in a gauge-origin-invariant manner. Frequency-dependent molecular properties can be calculated using linear, quadratic, and cubic response theory. A large number of singlet and triplet perturbation operators are available for the study of one-, two-, and three-photon processes. Environmental effects may be included using various dielectric-medium and quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics models. Large molecules may be studied using linear-scaling and massively parallel algorithms. Dalton is distributed at no cost from http://www.daltonprogram.org for a number of UNIX platforms.

The former regime, which encompasses the values of ω greater than ωcrit≈4.011{$\mkern1mu$}624×10−2, is characterized by the one-electron density ρ(ω;r1) with a global maximum at r1=0. In contrast, the harmonium atom within the latter regime, which corresponds to ω\&lt;ωcrit, differs fundamentally from both its weakly correlated counterpart and Coulombic systems. Resembling a Wigner crystal of a homogeneous electron gas, it possesses a radially localized pair of angularly correlated electrons that gives rise to ρ(ω;r1) with a “fat attractor” composed of a cage critical point and a (1, −1) critical sphere. Allowing for a continuous variation in ω, the new compact representation of the ground-state wave function and accurate approximants for the corresponding electronic properties are designed to facilitate the use of harmonium in research on electron correlation and density functionals.},

Ten conditions that have to be satisfied by Vee(n;g) uncover several characteristics of Vee[Γ(x′,x)].

This method enables a comparison of MCCI and truncated CI 2-RDMs with FCI values for a range of molecules, which includes stretched bonds and excited states. The accuracy in energies, wavefunctions, and 2-RDMs is seen to exhibit a similar behavior. We find that MCCI can reach sufficient accuracy of the 2-RDM using significantly fewer configurations than truncated CI, particularly for systems with strong multireference character.},

In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.}

  abstract = {The Hohenberg–Kohn theorem implies the existence of an energy functional based solely on the first‐order reduced density matrix of the ground state of an atomic or molecular system. Application of the variational principle for the functional EvM[γ] generates a set of coupled Euler equations for the representation coefficients and spin orbitals of a rank‐M approximation to the exact ground‐state density matrix. Defining the (assumed Hermitian) kernel FM[γ;x′,x]≡δEvM/δγ (x,x′), the equations in an arbitrary representation for the approximate density matrix, γ (x,x′) =ΣijMψ1(x) γijψj* (x′) are the following: ℱdξFM[γ;x′,ξ]ψi(ξ) =μψi(x′); i=1, 2,...,M; ℱdξFM[γ;x′,ξ] ΣMiψi(ξ) γ ij=ΣMiψi(x′) λij; j=1, 2, ...,M. The quantity μ is the chemical potential of the system of interest and the λij are a set of M2 Lagrange multipliers constraining the orthonormality of the spin orbital basis \{ψ\}. The coefficients γij must be chosen such that FM has the degenerate eigenvalue spectrum, FiiM=μ, i=1, 2,...,M, for all partially occupied orbitals. The spin orbitals, for a fixed set of coefficients, must be simultaneously determined so that λ is Hermitian. Provided all occupation numbers lie on the open interval (0,1), the stationary density matrix itself obeys the eigenvalue equation ℱdξFM[γ;x,ξ]γ (ξ,x′) =μγ (x,x′), and for any stationary density matrix the following commutation rules are valid: [FM[γ], γ]=0; [λ, γ]=0. The matrices γ and λ consequently can be brought simultaneously to diagonal form, and the canonical representation of the energy functional provides an eigenvalue equation determining the natural spin orbitals. The value of the chemical potential is μ=εi/ni, i=1, 2, ...,M; ε=diag (λ); from which follows the distribution function governing the occupation numbers of a stationary density matrix. Two limiting forms of the variational principle are examined, the exact and Hartree–Fock functionals, and related previous work by Gilbert is discussed. The physical content of the equations is illuminated by identification of the chemical potential as the negative of the electronegativity; Sanderson’s Principle of Electronegativity Equalization follows.},

In this work, we relate the sign of the natural amplitudes to the nature of the two-body interaction. We show that long-range Coulomb-type interactions are responsible for the appearance of positive amplitudes and give both analytical and numerical examples that illustrate how the long-distance structure of the wave function affects these amplitudes. We further demonstrate that the amplitudes show an avoided crossing behavior as function of a parameter in the Hamiltonian and use this feature to show that these amplitudes never become zero, except for special interactions in which infinitely many of them can become zero simultaneously when changing the interaction strength. This mechanism of avoided crossings provides an alternative argument for the non-vanishing of the natural occupation numbers in Coulomb systems.},

It is shown that, in this more general case, a nondegenerate ground-state wave function is a universal functional of the one-particle density kernel μ(x,x′), but probably not of the particle density n(→r)=Σsμ(→rs,→rs). The variational equations for the local and nonlocal cases are compared. The former must be replaced by a variational equation for an equivalent system of noninteracting particles, following a prescription of Kohn and Sham, in order to obtain a Schrödinger-like form, and contains only local potentials. The latter may be obtained directly in Schrödinger-like form, but the exchange-correlation potential is nonlocal. If the nonlocal pseudo-Hamiltonian exists [i.e., if the functional derivative δEδμ(x,x′) exists for a nondegenerate ground-state density kernel], then the eigenfunctions of the pseudo-Hamiltonian are natural spin orbitals, and all partially occupied orbitals (0{$<$}⟨φi|μ|φi⟩{$<$}1) belong to the same degenerate eigenvalue of the pseudo-Hamiltonian. Finally, it is shown, as a corollary of Coleman's theorem for N-representable density kernels, that any finite non-negative differentiable function is an N-representable particle density.},

  abstract = {An improved density matrix functional [correction to Buijse and Baerends functional (BBC)] is proposed, in which a hierarchy of physically motivated repulsive corrections is employed to the strongly overbinding functional of Buijse and Baerends (BB). The first correction C1 restores the repulsive exchange-correlation (xc) interaction between electrons in weakly occupied natural orbitals (NOs) as it appears in the exact electron pair density ρ2 for the limiting two-electron case. The second correction C2 reduces the xc interaction of the BB functional between electrons in strongly occupied NOs to an exchange-type interaction. The third correction C3 employs a similar reduction for the interaction of the antibonding orbital of a dissociating molecular bond. In addition, C3 applies a selective cancellation of diagonal terms in the Coulomb and xc energies (not for the frontier orbitals). With these corrections, BBC still retains a correct description of strong nondynamical correlation for the dissociating electron pair bond. BBC greatly improves the quality of the BB potential energy curves for the prototype few-electron molecules and in several cases BBC reproduces very well the benchmark ab initio potential curves. The average error of the self-consistent correlation energies obtained with BBC3 for prototype atomic systems and molecular systems at the equilibrium geometry is only ca. 6\%.},

In a given spin-orbital basis, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Slater determinants with spin orbitals in canonical order and the occupation-number (ON) vectors in the Fock space. In second quantization, all operators and states can be constructed from a set of elementary creation and annihilation operators. The chapter turns to operators that conserve the particle number and thus couple ON vectors in the same subspace. The explicit form of these number-conserving operators depends on whether the first-quantized operator is a one-electron operator or a two-electron operator. One-electron operators are discussed followed by two-electron operators along with the second-quantization representation of the electronic Hamiltonian operator.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+˜n(r), ˜nn0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract The cumulant expansion gives rise to a useful decomposition of the two-matrix D in which the pair correlated matrix (cumulant) is disconnected from the antisymmetric product of the one-matrix Γ. A new explicit antisymmetric approach for the two-particle cumulant matrix in terms of two symmetric matrices, Δ and Λ, as functionals of the occupation numbers is proposed for singlet ground states of closed-shell systems. It produces a natural orbital functional that reduces to the exact expression for the total energy in two-electron systems. The functional form of matrix Λ is readily generalized to any system with an even number of electrons. The diagonal elements of Δ equal the square of the occupation numbers, and the N-representability positivity necessary conditions of the two-matrix impose several bounds on the off-diagonal elements of matrix Δ. The well-known mean value theorem and the partial sum rule obtained for the off-diagonal elements of Δ provide a prescription for deriving a practical functional. In particular, when the mean values J of the Coulomb interactions Jij for a given orbital i taking over all orbitals j ≠ i are assumed to be equal Kii/2, a functional close to self-interaction-corrected GU functional is obtained, but the two-matrix fermionic antisymmetric holds. An additional term for the matrix elements of Λ between HF occupied orbitals is proposed to ensure a correct description of the occupation numbers for the lowest occupied levels. The functional is tested in fully variational finite basis set calculations of 57 molecules. It gives reasonable molecular energies at the equilibrium geometries. The calculated values of dipole moments are in good agreement with the available experimental data. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2006},

They serve as a basis for the ad hoc construction of the second-order reduced density matrix in terms of the first-order reduced density matrix and lead to implicit functionals where the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals are obtained as diagonal elements of an idempotent matrix the elements of which represent the variational parameters to be optimized. The numerical results obtained from a first realization of such an implicit density matrix functional give excellent agreement with the results of full configuration interaction calculations for four-electron systems like LiH and Be. Results for H2O taken as an example for a somewhat larger molecule are numerically less satisfactory but still give reasonable occupation numbers of the natural orbitals and indicate the capability of density matrix functional theory to cope with static electron correlation.},

  abstract = {Analytic energy gradients are presented for a variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (2-RDM)-driven complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method. The active-space 2-RDM is determined using a semidefinite programing (SDP) algorithm built upon an augmented Lagrangian formalism. Expressions for analytic gradients are simplified by the fact that the Lagrangian is stationary with respect to variations in both the primal and the dual solutions to the SDP problem. Orbital response contributions to the gradient are identical to those that arise in conventional CASSCF methods in which the electronic structure of the active space is described by a full configuration interaction (CI) wave function. We explore the relative performance of variational 2-RDM (v2RDM)- and CI-driven CASSCF for the equilibrium geometries of 20 small molecules. When enforcing two-particle N-representability conditions, full-valence v2RDM-CASSCF-optimized bond lengths display a mean unsigned error of 0.0060 Å and a maximum unsigned error of 0.0265 Å, relative to those obtained from full-valence CI-CASSCF. When enforcing partial three-particle N-representability conditions, the mean and maximum unsigned errors are reduced to only 0.0006 and 0.0054 Å, respectively. For these same molecules, full-valence v2RDM-CASSCF bond lengths computed in the cc-pVQZ basis set deviate from experimentally determined ones on average by 0.017 and 0.011 Å when enforcing two- and three-particle conditions, respectively, whereas CI-CASSCF displays an average deviation of 0.010 Å. The v2RDM-CASSCF approach with two-particle conditions is also applied to the equilibrium geometry of pentacene; optimized bond lengths deviate from those derived from experiment, on average, by 0.015 Å when using a cc-pVDZ basis set and a (22e,22o) active space.},

The coefficients of the Padé approximant are optimized for a test set of eight molecules, and then refined for a larger set of 35molecules. Two different approaches were tried, either keeping the self-interaction terms, or by removing them explicitly from the functional. The functionals thus obtained involve very few parameters, but are able to outperform other RDMFT functionals, yielding correlation energies that are, on average, even slightly better than second-order Møller-Plesset theory.},

The great advantage of density matrix functionals, as opposed to density functionals, is their ability to describe such processes since they naturally cover both nondynamical and dynamical correlation. This is obvious in the Löwdin-Shull functional, the exact natural orbital functional for two-electron systems. We present in this paper extensions of this functional for the breaking of a single electron pair bond in N-electron molecules, using LiH, BeH+, and Li2 molecules as prototypes. Attention is given to the proper formulation of the functional in terms of not just J and K integrals but also the two-electron L integrals (K integrals with a different distribution of the complex conjugation of the orbitals), which is crucial for the calculation of response functions. Accurate energy curves are obtained with extended Löwdin-Shull functionals along the complete dissociation coordinate using full CI calculations as benchmark.},

  abstract = {The authors have investigated the description of the dispersion interaction within the Piris natural orbital functional (PNOF) theory. The PNOF arises from an explicit antisymmetric approach for the two-particle cumulant in terms of two symmetric matrices, Δ and Λ. The functional forms of these matrices are obtained from the generalization of the two-particle system expressions, except for the off-diagonal elements of Δ. The mean value theorem and the partial sum rule obtained for the off-diagonal elements of Δ provide a prescription for deriving practical functionals. In particular, the previous employed approximation \{Jpp∕2\} for the mean values \{Jp*\} affords several molecular properties but it is incapable to account for dispersion effects. In this work, the authors analyze a new approach for Jp* obtained by factorization of the matrix Δ within the bounds on its off-diagonal elements imposed by the positivity conditions of the two-particle reduced density matrix. Additional terms for the matrix elements of Λ proportional to the square root of the holes are again introduced to describe properly the occupation numbers of the lowest occupied levels. The authors have found that the cross products between weakly occupied orbitals must be removed from the functional form of Λ to obtain a correct long-range asymptotic behavior. The PNOF is used to predict the binding energy as well as the equilibrium distance of the helium dimer. The results are compared with the full configuration-interaction calculations and the corresponding experimental data.},

The Piris reconstruction functional, PNOF, which is based on an explicit form of the two-particle cumulant λ(Δ,Λ) satisfying necessary positivity conditions for the two-particle reduced density matrix, is used to reconstruct the latter. A new approach Λ(3), as well as an extension of the known Δαβ to spin-uncompensated systems lead to PNOF3. The theory is applied to the calculation of the total energies of the first- and second-row atoms (H–Ne) and a number of selected small molecules. The energy differences between the ground state and the lowest-lying excited state with different spin for these atoms, and the atomization energies of the considered molecules are also presented.

Then, we have derived a natural orbital functional, the Piris Natural Orbital Functional 5, PNOF5, constrained to fulfill the D, Q, and G positivity necessary conditions of the N-representable 2-RDM. This functional yields a remarkable accurate description of systems bearing substantial (near)degeneracy of one-particle states. The theory is applied to the homolitic dissociation of selected diatomic molecules and to the rotation barrier of ethylene, both paradigmatic cases of near-degeneracy effects. It is found that the method describes correctly the dissociation limit yielding an integer number of electrons on the dissociated atoms. PNOF5 predicts a barrier of 65.6 kcal/mol for the ethylene torsion in an outstanding agreement with Complete Active Space Second-order Perturbation Theory (CASPT2). The obtained occupation numbers and pseudo one-particle energies at the ethylene transition state account for fully degenerate π orbitals. The calculated equilibrium distances, dipole moments, and binding energies of the considered molecules are presented. The values obtained are accurate comparing those obtained by the complete active space self-consistent field method and the experimental data.},

  abstract = {An interacting-pair model is considered to attain a new natural orbital functional (NOF). The new approach, which will be termed PNOF6, belongs to the \$\textbackslash mathcal \{JKL\}\$JKL-only family of NOFs known in the literature as PNOFi. Accordingly, the approximated two-particle reduced density matrix (RDM) is reconstructed from the one-particle RDM, considering an explicit form of the two-particle cumulant in terms of the occupation numbers, and enforcing (2,2)-positivity conditions for the N-representability of the 2-RDM. PNOF6 is superior to its predecessor, PNOF5, which is an independent-pair approach. The functional is able to treat both dynamic and static correlations, thereby putting together the advantages of the other members of this series. The theory is applied to the dissociation of selected diatomic molecules. The equilibrium distances, dipole moments, harmonic frequencies, anharmonicity constants, and binding energies of the considered molecules are presented. Comparative potential energy curves for the deformation of benzene are given at the PNOF5 and PNOF6 levels of theory. In benzene, PNOF5 breaks the symmetry by about 1.5°, with an energy lowering of almost 3 kcal/mol, whereas PNOF6 provides the correct D6h symmetry.},

A particular reconstruction of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) based on the cumulant expansion is discussed. The cumulant is expressed by two auxiliary matrices, which are constrained to certain bounds due to the N-representabilty conditions of the 2-RDM. Appropriate forms of these matrices lead to different implementations known in the literature as PNOFi (i = 1–5). The strengths and weaknesses of PNOF5 are assessed. Its main strength is its ability to deal with the intrapair electron correlation at a reasonable computational cost. Its main limitation is the absence of the interpair electron correlation.

  abstract = {A recently proposed series of corrections to the earliest JK-only functionals has considerably improved the prospects of density matrix functional theory (DMFT). Still, the most advanced of these functionals (correction C3) requires a preselection of the terms in the pair density Γ(r1,r2) involving the bonding and antibonding natural orbitals (NOs) belonging to an electron pair bond. Ideally, a DMFT functional should only depend on the NOs and their occupation numbers, and we propose a functional with an occupation number driven weighing of terms in the pair density. These are formulated as “damping” for certain ranges of occupation numbers of the two-electron cumulant that arises in the expansion of the two-particle density matrix of the paradigmatic two-electron system. This automatic version of C3, which we denote AC3, provides the correct dissociation limit for electron pair bonds and it excellently reproduces the potential energy curves of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method for the dissociation of the electron pair bond in the series of the ten-electron hydrides CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF. AC3 reproduces closely the experimental equilibrium distances and at Re it yields correlation energies of the ten-electron systems with an average error in the absolute values of only 3.3\% compared to the MRCI values. We stress the importance of treatment of strong correlation cases (NO occupation numbers differing significantly from 2.0 and 0.0) by appropriate terms in the cumulant.},

The van der Waals interaction, even if not leading to a distinct van der Waals well, affects the shape of the interaction potential in the van der Waals distance range of 5–9 bohrs and can be clearly distinguished from chemical bonding effects. In the NO basis the van der Waals interaction can be quantitatively covered with, apart from the ground state configurations (1σg)2 and (1σu)2, just the 4 configurations (2σg)2 and (2σu)2, and (1πu)2 and (1πg)2. The physics of the dispersion interaction requires and explains the peculiar relatively large positive CI coefficients of the doubly excited electron configurations (2σu)2 and (1πg)2 (the occupancy amplitudes of the 2σu and 1πgx, y NOs) in the distance range 5–9 bohrs, which have been observed before by Cioslowski and Pernal [Chem. Phys. Lett.\hphantom{,}430, 188 (2006)]10.1016/j.cplett.2006.08.111.

Hylleraas, Z. Physik 54, 347 (1929)], and Eckart [C. Eckart, Phys. Rev. 36, 878 (1930)]. It is shown that by using orbitals obtained by splitting a simple exponential function, a surprisingly large amount of the radial correlation energy may be taken into account, whereas an attempt to split the atomic self‐consistent field function for He led to a negative result. The lowest triplet state is also treated by using the same approach.},

  abstract = {Levy’s 1‐matrix energy functional (Ref. 4) is modified and extended to include all ensemble–representable l‐matrices in its domain. This constitutes both a generalization and a simplification of earlier observations by Gilbert. The generalization negates some criticisms of the Donnelly–Parr analysis of a 1‐matrix energy functional (Ref. 3) since it was assumed to be defined only for pure‐state representable 1‐matrices. Further study of this analysis suggests that the taking of arbitrary variations in the 1‐matrix at a certain point in their study may result in an invalid Euler equation for the 1‐matrix energy functional, although this does not alter the main results of that work. The redefinition of Levy’s functional to accommodate the larger domain allows direct application of Harriman’s analysis of the geometry of density matrices in finite dimensional situations. A decomposition of the equivalent of the Vee expectation value into two terms, one with explicit and another with implicit occupation number dependence, illustrates the role of N‐representability. The Vee expectation value is approximated by means of the Schwartz inequality.},

In the first Chapter we introduce the subject in the broader context of many-body quantum mechanics, and briefly sketch the history of the field. The second Chapter tries to summarise what is known about N-representability of reduced density matrices, and derives these results in a unified framework. The optimisation problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program. Three different algorithms are discussed in Chapter three, and their performance is compared. In Chapter four we show how symmetry can be exploited to reduce the computational cost considerably. Several applications of the method are discussed in Chapter five. We show that the standard two-index constraints fail in the strong-correlation limit of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. In Chapter six we identify the spin-adapted lifting conditions as the most compact constraints that can correctly describe this limit.},
