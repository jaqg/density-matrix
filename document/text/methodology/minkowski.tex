Also, a second metric is computed to directly compare the approximated 2-RDMs.
Taking one element of one 2-RDM as a point in the high-dimensional 4D space,
the Minkowski distance can be computed between a point in the 4D space given by the
exact 2-RDM and a point by the approximated 2-RDM.

The Minkowski distance (metric) of order $p$ for an approximated 2-RDM,
$ \mat{\tilde{\sordm}}$, with respect to the exact 2-RDM, $ \mat{\sordm}$,
is given by 
\begin{equation}
    d \left( \mat{\sordm} , \mat{\tilde{\sordm}} \right) =
    \left(
        \sum_{pqrs} \left| \sordm_{pqrs} - \tilde{\sordm}_{pqrs} \right|^p
    \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
    ,
\end{equation}
which reduces to the Manhattan distance for $p=1$, to the Euclidean distance
for $p=2$ and, in the limit, to the Chebyshev distance for $p \to \infty$.

Therefore, the Minkowski distance is a direct metric to test any approximated
2-RDM, resulting in a good approximation if $d \to 0$, and a bad approximation
for larger $d$'s.
In this sense, this metric has no value if only one approximated 2-RDM is tested,
as this distance has to be compared with other distances in order to establish
the quality of the approximation.
