\subsection{Equivalence between spin-orbital and coordinate representations}
% ------------
In this section, the equivalence relations between first and second quantization
formalisms for the density matrices are established.

% A relationship between the definition of the 1-RDM
% (\cref{eq:fordm-coordinate-representation})
% and 2-RDM (\cref{eq:sordm-coordinate-representation}) in the first quantization
% formalism, in the coordinate representation, and the one and two-electron
% density matrices in the spin-orbital representation 
% (\cref{eq:oedm-spin-representation,eq:tedm-spin-representation})
% can be stablished.

The one-electron density matrix in the spin-orbital representation was
introduced in second quantization for the evaluation of the expectation values
of one-electron operators in the form 
\begin{equation}
    \Braket{0 | \hat{g} | 0} =
    \sum_{pq} \oedm_{pq} g_{pq}
    ,
\end{equation}
with the $g_{pq}$ integrals 
\begin{equation}
    g_{pq} = \int
    \varphi_p \left( \mat{x}_1 \right)^{*} 
    g \left( \mat{x}_1 \right) 
    \varphi_q \left( \mat{x}_1 \right)
    \dd{ \mat{x}_1}
    .
\end{equation}

Combining both, the 1-RDM in the coordinates representation given in 
\cref{eq:fordm-coordinate-representation} can be written
in terms of the one-electron density matrix in the spin-orbital representation
given in \cref{eq:oedm-spin-representation} via the expansion theorem, as
\begin{equation}
    \fordm \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x}_1^{\prime} \right) =
    \sum_{pq} \oedm_{pq} 
    \varphi_p^{*} \left( \mat{x}_1^{\prime} \right)
    \varphi_q \left( \mat{x}_1 \right)
    .
\end{equation}

Similarly, the following relationship between the two-electron density matrix
in the coordinate representation (\cref{eq:sordm-coordinate-representation}) 
and that in the spin-orbital representation (\cref{eq:tedm-spin-representation})
may be established
\begin{equation}
    \sordm \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x}_2, \mat{x}_1^{\prime}, \mat{x}_2^{\prime} \right)
    =
    \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pqrs} \tedm_{pqrs}
    \varphi_p^{*}\left( \mat{x}_1^{\prime} \right)
    \varphi_q    \left( \mat{x}_1          \right)
    \varphi_r^{*}\left( \mat{x}_2^{\prime} \right)
    \varphi_s    \left( \mat{x}_2          \right)
    .
\end{equation}
