Many methods of electronic structure theory are based on variational
optimization of an energy functional.
An idempotent first-order reduced density matrix (1-RDM) is variationally
optimized in the Hartree-Fock (HF) method\mycite{kollmar2004structure}.

The 1-RDM is determined by the natural orbitals and their occupation
numbers\mycite{lowdin1955quantum}, leading to denote the corresponding energy
functional as density matrix functional (DMF) or natural orbital functional (NOF).
This is explained in detail in the following sections.

In the coordinate representation of first quantization,
the \textit{first-order reduced density matrix} (1-RDM), also called
\textit{one-particle reduced density matrix}, $\fordm$, is defined
for an $n$-electron wavefunction, $\Psi$, as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fordm-coordinate-representation}
    \fordm \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x}_1\myprime \right) =
    n \idotsint
    \Psi \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x_2}, \ldots,  \mat{x}_n \right)
    \Psi^{*} \left( \mat{x}_1\myprime, \mat{x_2}, \ldots,  \mat{x}_n \right)
    \dd{ \mat{x}_2} \cdots \dd{ \mat{x}_n}
    ,
\end{equation}
and the \textit{second-order reduced density matrix} (2-RDM), or
\textit{two-particle reduced density matrix}, $\sordm$, as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sordm-coordinate-representation}
    \sordm \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x}_2, \mat{x}_1\myprime, \mat{x}_2\myprime \right)
    =
    \frac{n\left( n - 1 \right)}{2} \idotsint
    \Psi \left( \mat{x}_1, \mat{x}_2, \mat{x}_3, \ldots,  \mat{x}_n \right)
    \Psi^{*} \left( \mat{x}_1\myprime, \mat{x}_2\myprime, \mat{x}_3, \ldots,  \mat{x}_n \right)
    \dd{ \mat{x}_3} \cdots \dd{ \mat{x}_n}
    ,
\end{equation}
where $ \mat{x} = \left( \mat{r}, s \right)$ is a combined spatial and spin
coordinate.

% An inmidiate advantage of using 1-RDM instead of the electron density, $\rho$,
% is that the kinetic energy is an explicit functional of $\fordm$ but not of
% $\rho$.
Employing the 1-RDM rather than the electron density, $\rho$, has the immediate
advantage of making the kinetic energy an explicit functional of $\fordm$ rather
than $\rho$.

% Then, there is no need to introduce a ficticious noninteracting system.
Then, introducing a fictitious noninteracting system is not necessary.

% Moreover, orbitals present in Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory (RDMFT)
% are fractionally occupied, so functionals 
% of $\fordm$ seem to be better suited to account for static correlation.
Furthermore, fractionally occupied orbitals are a feature of Reduced Density 
Matrix Functional Theory (RDMFT), which suggests that functionals of $\fordm$ are 
better suited to explain static correlation.

Self-adjointness of $\fordm$, as defined in \cref{eq:fordm-coordinate-representation},
allows for its spectral representation\mycite{lowdin1955quantum}
\begin{equation}
    \fordm \left( \mat{x}, \mat{x}\myprime \right) =
    \sum_{p} n_p 
    \varphi_p \left( \mat{x} \right)
    \varphi_p^{*} \left( \mat{x}\myprime \right)
    .
\end{equation}

The eigenvalues of 1-RDM are called natural occupation numbers,
$\left\{ n_p \right\}$, and the eigenfunctions are known as natural
spin-orbitals, $\left\{ \varphi_p \right\}$.
% For convention, the indices $p,q,r,s$ are referred to natural spin-orbitals
% and $a,b,c,d$ to arbitrary one-eletron functions.
% Also, atomic units are employed throughout the document.
By convention, natural spin-orbitals are denoted by the indices $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$, 
and arbitrary one-electron functions by the indices $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. 

% Some properties of the natural spin-orbitals and occupation numbers, known as the 
% $n$-representability conditions, are:
% the ensemble n-representability conditions for the first-order reduced density
% matrix have a particularly simple form\mycite{coleman1963structure}
The ensemble $n$-representability conditions, which are some properties of the 
natural spin-orbitals and occupation numbers, have a particularly simple 
form\mycite{coleman1963structure} and read:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Self-adjointness of $\fordm$: implies orthonormality of the natural orbitals 
        \begin{equation} \label{ec:self-adjoint-condition}
            \int
            \varphi_p^{*} \left( \mat{x} \right)
            \varphi_q \left( \mat{x} \right)
            \dd{ \mat{x}}
            = \delta_{pq}
            \quad \forall_{p,q} 
            .
        \end{equation}
        
    \item By the LÃ¶wdin's normalization convention\mycite{lowdin1955quantum},
        $\fordm$ is assumed to be normalized to a number of electrons, $n$.
        Therefore, the natural occupancies sum up to $n$  
        \begin{equation} \label{ec:normalization-condition}
            \trace \left[ \fordm \right] =
            \sum_{p} \fordm_{pp} =
            \sum_{p} n_p =
            n
            .
        \end{equation}

    \item The occupation number, $n_p$, is nonnegative and not grater than 1 
    \begin{equation} \label{ec:occ-number-condition}
        0 \leq n_p \leq 1 \quad \forall_{p}
        .
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
